  <h3>Here's a timeline of Dr. Denavit's life:</h3>
  <u1>
    <li>1930 - Born on October 1st in Paris, France.</li>
    <li>1952 - Denavit graduates from the       University of Paris with undergraduate degrees in General Mathematics, and Physics.</li>
    <li>1953 - Denavit receives a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from Northwestern University.</li>
    <li>1954 - Marries Catherine Dahlinger of Nashville, Tennessee.</li>
    <li>1955 - Co-authors A Kinematic notation for lower pair mechanisms based on matrices with Richard Hartenberg.</li>
    <li>1956 - Denavit continued advanced studies at Northwestern University, and earns a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering</li>
    <li>1958 - Accepts Professorship at Northwestern University in Mechanical, and Nuclear Engineering.</li>
    <li>1964 - Denavit co-authored Kinetic Synthesis of Linkages with Richard Hartenberg.  The publication introduces Denavit-Hartenberg convention, also known as D-H convention.  D-H convention is a mathematical frame of reference for the synthesis, and analysis, of spatial mechanisms.</li>
    <li>1969 - Accepts position as Research Physicist in the Plasma Physics Division of the Naval Research Laboratory until 1971.</li>
    <li>1981 - Richard Paul publishes Robot Manipulators demonstrating D-H conventions value for kinematic analysis of robotic systems.</li>
    <li>1982 - Leaves Northwestern University, and accepts position as Research Physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.</li>
    <li>1993 - Retires from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.</li>
    <li>2013 - Dies on September 12th in Pleasanton, Californa at the age of 82.</li>
