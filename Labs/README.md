# Lab exercises for practicing Computer Science fundamentals.

## Directories

## CS1063 Intro to Computer Programming at UTSA

Cs1063Lab0 - Exercise to learn the Java program 
format-Class, Main method.  Practice using 
print statements.

Cs1063Lab1 - Decompose task into subtasks by use 
of static methods.  Call static methods in main 
method.

Cs1063Lab2 - Exercise using methods, local 
variables, arithmetic expressions, class constants.
Use Scanner class to input values by creating 
scanner object.  Use print statements to request 
user input, than record user input through scanner 
object.  Store scanner object into variables.

Cs1063Lab6 - Exercise using random class for 
simulations.  Call methods with parameters and 
return values.  Use Scanner and Random classes. 
Use while statements.

Cs1063Lab8 - Exercise for converting a decimal 
number into a binary number.  Call methods with 
parameters and return values.  Use for loops 
and while loops.  Use arrays.


## CS 3443 Application Programming at UTSA

Cs3443Lab1 - Exercise for practicing file 
processing.  Program read in tokens from a file. 
Prints out three values: the number of tokens 
that are numbers (doubles), the number of tokens 
that are not numbers, and the sum of the numbers.  
The program outputs values to an output file.

Cs3443Lab2 - Exercise for building a client 
program, and Class/object file.  Client file reads 
in a data file, constructs an array and creates 
objects. The client program will run test printing 
out processed data from Class/object file.  The 
Class/object file constructs the array object, 
contains toString, getlength, average, sortArray, 
median, maximum, minimum methods.
